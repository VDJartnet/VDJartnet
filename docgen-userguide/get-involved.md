### Submitting Bug Reports

If you have any programming experience and are willing to fix it please see the [programming guidelines](#programming-guidelines)

### Feature suggestions
If you want to suggest that we add a feature then please do open an issue if one doesn't already exist but we may well not have time to implement it for a while so if you want the feature then I suggest that you try to add it yourself, if so please see the [programming guidelines](#programming-guidelines)

### Programming Guidelines
If you wish to contribute directly to VDJartnet then I suggest that you first open an issue if one doesn't already exist and check as we may have recommendations on how you can best implement your suggested improvements. Then you can implement your feature and submit a pull request.
