### Submitting Bug Reports
If you find a bug please open an issue if one doesn't already exist for this bug though please do note that we are very busy and as such may not be able to fix it immediately. If you have any programming experience and are willing to fix it please see the [programming guidelines](#programming-guidelines)

### Feature suggestions
If you want to suggest that we add a feature then please do open an issue if one doesn't already exist but we may well not have time to implement it for a while so if you want the feature then I suggest that you try to add it yourself, if so please see the [programming guidelines](#programming-guidelines)

### Preset Development
If you have written new presets which you would like to be included by default in VDJartnet then you should open a pull request on github in the usual manner. It is important that you indicate that you are releasing the presets under the 3-clause BSD licence, which is the licence we are using to distribute the presets file, this is separate to the wider plugin which is only available under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](https://github.com/VDJartnet/VDJartnet/blob/master/COPYING).

### Programming Guidelines
If you wish to contribute directly to VDJartnet then we suggest that you first open an issue if one doesn't already exist and check as we may have recommendations on how you can best implement your suggested improvements. Then you can implement your feature and submit a pull request.

See [the developers documentation](developers.html) for details on how to develop features for VDJartnet as well as how to setup your environment.
